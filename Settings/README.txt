The config.ini file that is inside this same directory (WellMonitor/Settings/config.ini) is where you can change the settings of the site offline.

This is particularly useful in the case of a disconnect to the site, or in the case that you no longer have access to the device via SSH or the site itself. 

The file contains comments for how to properly edit these values, and they should be simple enough to change should they need to be. The settings will also be available
on the website itself, though be warned that changing the networking settings will require a refresh of the browser and connecting to the IP and port you specify.
